* PPM

A function that calculates proportion of element contained in a solid, 
expressed as mass units of element per mass units of sample (g, ug, mg, 
Kg), after being processed through a solution, particularly useful 
after reading absorbance AA, ICP, etc.

Given the following parameters

   - =solid= mass of the solid processed in a solution
   - =solution= volume of the solution where the solid was processed
   - =concentration= concentration obtained after the lecture
   - =solid.u= units in which the solid is expressed (default "g")
   - =solution.u= units in which the solution is expressed (default "ml")
   - =concentration.u= units of mass per Liter, in which the concentratoin is expressed (default "mg" for mg/L)
   - =result.element= units of mass of element per units of mass of sample (i.e. mg/Kg = ppm)
   - =result.sample=  units of mass of element per units of mass of sample

Returns the proportion of element contained in a solid, expressed in 
terms specified under =result.units=
