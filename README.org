The general idea for this repository is to work on mathematical
exercises to help myself learn other programming languages such
as python and common lisp. As my main experience if in R, most
of this exercises are first develop in R and then I learn how
to translate it into other desired language.

The complexity of the first exercises is rather simple, but my
plan is to increase the level gradually as my skills improve,
particularly in Python which is my main target right now.

Commentaries, critics, questions and contributions are welcome,
especially if they are intended to be constructive.
