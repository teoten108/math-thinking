* MATHEMATICAL THINKING
Repository with basic excercises to develop mathematical thinking and learn programing.

* SYNOPSIS
The general idea is to develop excercises for mathematical thinking in R, where my skills are better, and then translate it to common lisp and python.

* EXERCISES
Each folder contains the code for each task in the 3 different programing languages.

** Darts
*Computing pi by throwing Darts*, or by simulating the random process of throwing darts at a squared board with a circle drawn inside it.

** Walk
*Random walk* emulation, also known as stochastic or random process, that describes a path based on random integers.
